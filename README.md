> Classifying Cammeo and Osmancik rice varieties using 7 morphological traits and machine learning models. This project explores both a baseline (Logistic Regression) and an ensemble method (Random Forest), comparing their performance and visualizing key insights. Originally explored in a group project, I later revisited and rebuilt the analysis independently, extended it with additional evaluation (10-run reliability check).

### Why I Built This
- Practice **end-to-end ML workflow** (EDA â†’ training â†’ evaluation â†’ visualization)  
- Extend the work with **extra evaluation** (10-run statistics, logistic regression baseline)
  
This project gave me the opportunity to:
- Explore **7 morphological traits** of rice grains (Area, Perimeter, Axis Lengths, etc.)  
- Apply **Random Forest** and compare it with a **Logistic Regression baseline**  
- Practice **visual analysis** (scatter plots, boxplots, feature importance)  
- Repeated runs (with different seeds) improve **reliability of results**
